Description:
    Finds coordinates and direction (angle) of a sequence of photos with no GPS
    exif tags. In JOSM (Java editor for OpenStreetMap), manually identify points
    that can be located exactly, then interpolate in-between points with R.
    Repeat the procedure until the approximation is good enough.
